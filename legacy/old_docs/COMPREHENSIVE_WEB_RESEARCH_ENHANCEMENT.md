   - Session state synchronization

2. **Markdown Storage** (`data/learned_knowledge.md`)
   - Human-readable knowledge records
   - Multi-page documentation
   - Persistent learning documentation

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Comprehensive Web Research Flow**
1. **URL Input** → User pastes URL and clicks "Extract Content"
2. **Complete Content Extraction** → Extracts ALL readable content types
3. **Link Discovery** → Finds and follows links within same domain (up to 2 levels)
4. **Multi-Page Processing** → Processes main page and all linked pages
5. **Content Analysis** → Rewrites and analyzes all content with insights
6. **Structured Display** → Shows content breakdown and linked pages preview
7. **Multi-Page Saving** → Saves main page and all linked pages separately
8. **AI Integration** → All content immediately available in Chat tab

### **Intelligent Chat Synthesis Flow**
1. **Question Asked** → User asks question in Chat tab
2. **Multi-Source Search** → AI searches across all saved knowledge (main + linked pages)
3. **Information Organization** → Groups information by topics and relationships
4. **Synthesis** → Combines information from multiple sources
5. **Comprehensive Response** → Provides detailed analysis with source attribution
6. **Relationship Context** → Shows how different pages relate to each other

### **Persistent Memory Flow**
1. **App Start** → Loads all saved knowledge from disk (main + linked pages)
2. **Session Sync** → Keeps session state synchronized with storage
3. **Multi-Page Auto-Save** → Saves all pages immediately
4. **Data Survival** → All data persists across restarts with relationships intact

## 📊 **Example Usage**

### **Comprehensive Web Research Example**
1. User enters: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence`
2. AI extracts:
   - **Main Page**: Complete Wikipedia article with all sections
   - **Linked Pages**: Related articles like "Machine Learning", "Neural Networks", etc.
   - **Structured Content**: Headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links
   - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Content type, themes, insights
3. User sees:
   - Content breakdown by type (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
   - Linked pages preview with summaries
   - Total pages discovered and processed
4. User saves to knowledge base
5. All pages (main + linked) immediately available in Chat

### **Intelligent Chat Synthesis Example**
1. User asks: "What is artificial intelligence and how does machine learning relate to it?"
2. AI searches saved knowledge and finds:
   - Main page: "Artificial Intelligence" 
   - Linked page: "Machine Learning"
   - Related information from both sources
3. AI responds with comprehensive synthesis:
   - **Comprehensive Analysis from 2 Sources**
   - **1. Artificial Intelligence**: Summary, insights, key facts
   - **2. Machine Learning**: Summary, insights, key facts  
   - **Related Information**: Shows how pages connect
   - **Synthesis**: Combines information for complete understanding
